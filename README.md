# Welcome to My Personal Website!

I wanted a simple, minimal space online to sort of own my presence and share a bit about myself. I’ve relied on my own knowledge and various resources from the internet, including:

- **YouTube tutorials**
- **Web development forums**
- **Documentation and articles**

I finally have a space that feels like my own home. Feel free to explore, fork, and create your own site if you’re inspired!

## Why This Project Exists

- I wanted a simple space to share a bit about myself without all the details it used to have.
- This site reflects my interests and what drives me.
- You can also find "My Portfolio" for links to my socials, and more!

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the website.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet for styling the website.
- **email.html**: A page containing my PGP key and email for secure communication.
- **SignalGroupQr.png**: An image of my Signal username and QR code for contact.
- **duck.gif**: A fun GIF of a spinning duck.
